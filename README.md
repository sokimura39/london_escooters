# London E-scooter analysis

This analysis was done as the final assessment for the [Geographic Information Systems and Science module](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo/) led by Dr. Andy MacLachlan at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis as part of the MSc Urban Spatial Science module. The link above leads to the open-source course material for this module.

## Assessment Question

The original question was as follows:

> ## E-scooter casualties 
>
> The London Mayor is reviewing the use of e-scooters within the City and wants to understand where e-scooter accidents happen. You have been enlisted as a consultant and tasked to conduct an analysis of their data.
> 
> You should use appropriate data processing and analysis methods to produce an overview report which summarises the patterns revealed in the data. It is expected that at least some of the methods you use will relate to the spatial dimensions of the data.
> 
> Your report should include a brief introduction including relevant contextual information at the beginning and a critical review of your findings at the end. You must include at least one map. 
> 
> ### Data
> 
> All the road accident data can be downloaded from: https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data You will need to click show more. The following datasets (from the above website) may be useful:
> 
> * 2020-2022 E Scooter accident data
> * Road collision data per year (containing latitude and longitude) that can be joined to other data. 
> * Road casualty data containing a row for each casualty in a collision (e.g. if a collision has two casualties there will be two rows, one for each person, with the same accident index).
> * Road Safety Open Dataset Data Guide -2022, at the very bottom of the webpage
> * London LSOA boundaries: https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/statistical-gis-boundary-files-london 
> 
> You may wish to use open street map data, although it is not necessary to answer the question. 
> 
> * London shapefile (big data!): https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/united-kingdom/england/greater-london.html
